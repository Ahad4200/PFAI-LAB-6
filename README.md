## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for PFAI Lab 6, which uses a lighter model to avoid server timeouts. The project is developed using RStudio, and the final output is an R Markdown file named "task with efficient model.Rmd".

## PositCloud's Server Timeouts

Due to server timeouts, we had to use a lighter model of Random Forest to ensure that the computations could be completed within the available time. This model is more efficient and allows us to achieve our goals without running into performance issues.
